to create html file type html:5 and tab

document.createElement("h1"); to create html element in javascript

const heading = document.createElement("h1"); // for creation of h1 tag
heading.innerHTML = "hello world from javascript"; putting value in h1 tag
const root = document.getElementById("root"); find div with id root.
root.appendChild(heading); passing h1 to it.

what is cdn? content dilvery network.

what is crossorigin in react cdn.
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
this core file for react.

<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
this is dom manipulation.

why not club together bzc react work on both web & phone

a) const heading = React.createElement("h1",{//place for attribute like id:"heading" for h1 tag },"Hello world from react"); // here we have used react feature bzc that work of react to create element
b) const root = ReactDom.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")); // but here we have we used react dome bzc that work dom to interact with html stuff
C) root.render(heading); // normal reader part. render convert all react code to html part.

above a & b statement are javascript object, until they are render.
most costly operation in web in add and delete of node and to manuplate it.

React.createElement => object,
reader = html(browser understands)

[React.createElement("h1",{id:"heading1"},"I am h1 tag."),React.createElement("h2",{},"I am h2 tag.")]
for multiple children create array of children.

but it can become headace when it is to much nested element for that reason we have JSX

sequence of file is imp
bzc react
    ReactDom
    app.js



what is diff btw development and production react.js cdn
react replace everything in root with it.
react is library.
it can work wherever it is called.
framework where whole app should developed with but react can be injected in per existing code of js
